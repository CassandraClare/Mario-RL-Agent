# Mario-RL-Agent
The goal of this project is to create a DQN in order to play Super Mario Bros. I used the gym-super-mario-bros environment, which is built on top of the OpenAI gym library. A state of the game is represented by a list of 4 consecutive frames of 240 × 256 × 3 (height × width × 3 channels RGB). The size of the action space in this game is 256 which corresponds to 256 possible actions of the character.
